# A-Level-Poker-Game
A poker game that I made as part of my A-Level coursework. (2024 AQA A-Level Computer Science)

Alot of the code is quite bad; using bad practices and methods etc, part of the code is also quite temperamental - especially the networking part of the code. Overall this project has made me never want to touch Python ever again. At somepoint I plan to learn a real language that doesn't break with multi-threading.

Whether you want to look at horrible code and laugh at it and learn not what to do, or a A-Level Computer Science student looking for previous examples and or ideas for their coursework (first of I recommend not making a game as to keep your scope simple) I hope you can find some help or whatever in my attempt. Just remember if you are making your own program for your coursework - dont plagarise!!
